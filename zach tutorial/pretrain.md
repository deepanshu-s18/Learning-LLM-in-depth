# **Title: LLM Pre-Training in 30 Minutes**

### Introduction: The Magic is Just Math

You've mastered how a neural network learns. You've seen the elegant dance of gradient descent and backpropagation, the mathematical engine that allows a machine to get progressively better at a task by minimizing its error. But that was with numbers. Clean, predictable, logical numbers.

Now we tackle language.

When a model like ChatGPT writes code, explains quantum physics, or composes a sonnet, it seems like magic. Here's the secret: it's the *exact same learning process*, applied relentlessly to one deceptively simple task: **predict the next token.**

In this tutorial, we will deconstruct the GPT-2 pre-training pipeline step by step. You will learn the exact algorithms and mathematics that allow a machine to teach itself from the raw, unlabeled text of the internet. We will build the entire conceptual pipeline, showing you exactly how "The cat sat on the" becomes a prediction for "mat," and how doing this billions of times creates the emergent intelligence you see today.

We will cover three key stages, anchored by this roadmap:

graph LR
    subgraph "Part 1 & 2: Data Preparation"
        A[Raw Text] --> B{Training Data Algorithm}
        B --> C[Input Token IDs]
    end
    subgraph "Part 3: The Learning Loop"
        C --> D["Model (Embeddings + Transformer)"]
        D --> E[Output Logits]
        E --> F[Softmax -> Probabilities]
        F --> G["Cross-Entropy Loss (Error)"]
        G -.-> D
