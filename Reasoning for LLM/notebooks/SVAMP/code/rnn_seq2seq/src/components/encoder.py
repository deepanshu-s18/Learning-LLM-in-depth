class Encoder(nn.Module):
	'''
	Encoder helps in building the sentence encoding module for a batched version
	of data that is sent in [T x B] having corresponding input lengths in [1 x B]

	Args:
			hidden_size: Hidden size of the RNN cell
			embedding: Embeddings matrix [vocab_size, embedding_dim]
			cell_type: Type of RNN cell to be used : LSTM, GRU
			nlayers: Number of layers of LSTM (default = 1)
			dropout: Dropout Rate (default = 0.1)
			bidirectional: Bidirectional model to be formed (default: False)
